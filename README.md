#### Dataset

[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

#### Files

* `CodeBook.md` a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations performed to the original dataset

* `run_analysis.R` performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course project's definition:
    + Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    + Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    + Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    + Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    + From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    
* `FinalData.txt` is the exported final data in a plain text format.
